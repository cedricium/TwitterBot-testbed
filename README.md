# TwitterBot-testbed ([@twitbot_testbed](https://twitter.com/twitbot_testbed))

### About
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with Node.js and practice using different APIs in order to create something interesting. I also hope to gain experience working with VMs and deploying the bot on various instances such as Heroku and AWS.

### How It Works
The code for this repository utilizes the `git tag` feature which follows semantic versioning guidelines. Every major version X (X.y.z) will be a bot with a totally different purpose than the last major version (starting with 1.0.0). Minor versions Y (x.Y.z) will be new features/enhancements for the current major version X, and patch version Z (x.y.Z) will be used for bug corrections corresponding to the current major version X.

### Conclusion
I highly recommend you follow [@twitbot_testbed](https://twitter.com/twitbot_testbed) and interact with it as time goes on. I hope to update it (yes it is genderless) regularly, my schedule permitting. Eventually it will be a very confused bot since it will have so many different personalities.

## Current Bot
